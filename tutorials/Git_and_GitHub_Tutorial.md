## Introduction to Version Control

### What is Version Control?

Version control is a system that records changes to files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. It allows multiple people to collaborate on projects, track changes, and revert to previous states if needed.

### Types of Version Control Systems

1. **Local Version Control Systems (LVCS)**:
   - Store file changes in a local database
   - Examples: RCS (Revision Control System)
   - Limitations: No collaboration capabilities, vulnerable to local disk failure

2. **Centralized Version Control Systems (CVCS)**:
   - Store files on a central server
   - Examples: SVN (Subversion), CVS (Concurrent Versions System)
   - Advantages: Better collaboration, centralized control
   - Limitations: Server is a single point of failure, slower due to network dependencies

3. **Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCS)**:
   - Every user has a complete copy of the repository
   - Examples: Git, Mercurial, Bazaar
   - Advantages: No dependency on central server, better performance, more flexible workflows

### Benefits of Version Control

- **History and Tracking**: Maintains a record of all changes made to files over time
- **Collaboration**: Enables multiple people to work on the same project simultaneously
- **Backup and Recovery**: Acts as a safety net for your code
- **Experimentation**: Allows you to try new ideas without risk
- **Documentation**: Provides a log of what changed, when, and by whom

## Understanding Git

### What is Git?

Git is a distributed version control system created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for Linux kernel development. It's designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

### Git vs. Other Version Control Systems

- **Distributed Nature**: Unlike SVN or CVS, Git gives each developer a local copy of the entire repository
- **Speed**: Git operations are performed locally, making them much faster than CVCS
- **Branching**: Git has a lightweight branching system that makes creating and merging branches quick and easy
- **Data Integrity**: Git uses cryptographic hash functions to ensure data integrity
- **Staging Area**: Git's unique "staging area" concept allows for more granular commits

### Git Architecture

Git manages your data as a series of snapshots of a miniature filesystem:

1. **Working Directory**: The actual files you work with on your computer
2. **Staging Area (Index)**: A place to prepare changes before committing them
3. **Local Repository**: The .git directory that stores all versions and history
4. **Remote Repository**: A copy of the repository stored on another server (like GitHub)

### Git Data Model

Git's core data structures:

1. **Blob**: Stores file content
2. **Tree**: Represents directories and files
3. **Commit**: A snapshot of the repository at a specific point in time
4. **Reference**: Pointers to commits (like branches and tags)

## Getting Started with Git

### Installing Git

#### On Windows:
```bash
# Download from https://git-scm.com/download/win and run the installer
# OR using Chocolatey
choco install git
```

#### On macOS:
```bash
# Using Homebrew
brew install git

# OR using the installer
# Download from https://git-scm.com/download/mac
```

#### On Linux:
```bash
# Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install git

# Fedora
sudo dnf install git

# CentOS/RHEL
sudo yum install git
```

### Configuring Git

After installation, set up your identity:

```bash
# Set your username
git config --global user.name "Your Name"

# Set your email address
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"

# Set default editor (optional)
git config --global core.editor "code --wait"  # VS Code
# git config --global core.editor "vim"  # Vim
# git config --global core.editor "nano"  # Nano

# Set default branch name (for Git 2.28+)
git config --global init.defaultBranch main

# Check your configuration
git config --list
```

### Creating Your First Repository

#### Initializing a New Repository:

```bash
# Create a directory for your project
mkdir my-project
cd my-project

# Initialize Git repository
git init
```

#### Cloning an Existing Repository:

```bash
# Syntax: git clone <repository-url> [directory-name]
git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git my-local-copy
cd my-local-copy
```

## Essential Git Commands

### Basic Workflow Commands

#### Checking Status

```bash
# View the status of your working directory
git status
```

#### Adding Files to Staging Area

```bash
# Add a specific file
git add filename.txt

# Add multiple files
git add file1.txt file2.txt

# Add all files in the current directory
git add .

# Add all files of a specific type
git add *.txt

# Add all changes interactively (select chunks)
git add -p
```

#### Committing Changes

```bash
# Commit with message
git commit -m "Add new feature"

# Add changes and commit in one step (only works for tracked files)
git commit -am "Fix bug in login form"

# Amend the previous commit
git commit --amend -m "Updated commit message"
```

#### Viewing Changes

```bash
# Show unstaged changes
git diff

# Show staged changes
git diff --staged

# Show changes between commits
git diff commit1..commit2

# Show commit details
git show <commit-hash>
```

#### Viewing History

```bash
# View commit history
git log

# View history with graph visualization
git log --graph --oneline --all

# View history for a specific file
git log -p filename.txt

# View history with a condensed summary
git log --oneline

# View history with stats
git log --stat
```

### Working with Remote Repositories

#### Adding a Remote

```bash
# Add a remote repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repository.git

# List remote repositories
git remote -v

# Change remote URL
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/username/new-repository.git
```

#### Syncing with Remote

```bash
# Download changes from remote repository
git fetch origin

# Download changes and merge them into your current branch
git pull origin main

# Upload local changes to remote repository
git push origin main

# Push a new branch to remote
git push -u origin feature-branch
```

### Undoing Changes

#### Unstaging Files

```bash
# Unstage a file without losing changes
git restore --staged filename.txt  # Git 2.23+
git reset HEAD filename.txt        # Older Git versions
```

#### Discarding Changes

```bash
# Discard changes in working directory
git restore filename.txt           # Git 2.23+
git checkout -- filename.txt       # Older Git versions

# Discard all changes
git restore .                      # Git 2.23+
git checkout -- .                  # Older Git versions
```

#### Reverting Commits

```bash
# Create a new commit that undoes changes from a specific commit
git revert <commit-hash>
```

#### Resetting

```bash
# Move HEAD and branch pointer, keep changes in working directory
git reset --mixed <commit-hash>

# Move HEAD and branch pointer, discard changes
git reset --hard <commit-hash>

# Move HEAD and branch pointer, keep changes staged
git reset --soft <commit-hash>
```

## Git Branching Strategies

### Understanding Branches

A branch in Git is simply a lightweight movable pointer to a commit. When you create a branch, all Git needs to do is create a new pointerâ€”it doesn't change the repository in any other way.

```bash
# List all branches
git branch

# List remote branches
git branch -r

# List all branches (local and remote)
git branch -a
```

### Creating and Switching Branches

```bash
# Create a new branch
git branch feature-x

# Create and switch to a new branch
git checkout -b feature-y

# Using Git 2.23+ switch command
git switch -c feature-z  # Create and switch
git switch main          # Switch to existing branch
```

### Merging Branches

```bash
# Switch to the target branch (where changes will be merged to)
git checkout main

# Merge the feature branch into the current branch
git merge feature-x

# Merge with a custom commit message
git merge feature-x -m "Merge feature X into main"
```

### Handling Merge Conflicts

When Git can't automatically resolve differences between branches, it creates a merge conflict:

1. Git will pause the merge
2. Files with conflicts will be modified to show both versions
3. You must manually edit the files to resolve conflicts
4. After resolving, you add and commit the changes

Example conflict markers:
```
<<<<<<< HEAD
This is the change in the current branch
=======
This is the change in the branch being merged
>>>>>>> feature-branch
```

Resolution process:
```bash
# After manual resolution of conflicts
git add resolved-file.txt
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflict"
```

### Rebasing

Rebasing is an alternative to merging that rewrites commit history to create a linear sequence of commits:

```bash
# Switch to the feature branch
git checkout feature-branch

# Rebase onto main
git rebase main

# Interactive rebase for more control
git rebase -i HEAD~3  # Rebase last 3 commits
```

### Common Branching Strategies

1. **Git Flow**:
   - `main`: Stable production code
   - `develop`: Integration branch for features
   - `feature/*`: New features
   - `release/*`: Preparing for a release
   - `hotfix/*`: Emergency fixes for production

2. **GitHub Flow**:
   - `main`: Always deployable
   - Feature branches: Created from main, merged back when ready

3. **GitLab Flow**:
   - `main`: Production-ready code
   - `pre-production`: Staging environment
   - `production`: Live production environment

4. **Trunk-Based Development**:
   - Short-lived feature branches
   - Frequent merges to main/trunk
   - Focus on continuous integration

## Understanding GitHub

## GitHub Workflows

### GitHub Issues

Issues are used to track ideas, feedback, tasks, bugs, and feature requests:

1. **Creating an Issue**:
   - Go to the Issues tab
   - Click "New issue"
   - Add a title and description
   - Add labels, assignees, and milestones if needed
   - Click "Submit new issue"

2. **Issue Templates**:
   - Create templates for bugs, features, etc.
   - Store in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE` directory

3. **Linking Issues to Pull Requests**:
   - Use keywords like "Fixes #123" in PR descriptions
   - This automatically closes the issue when PR is merged

### Pull Requests

Pull requests (PRs) let you propose changes to a repository:

1. **Creating a Pull Request**:
   - Create and commit changes on a branch
   - Push branch to GitHub
   - Go to repository on GitHub
   - Click "Compare & pull request"
   - Add title, description, and reviewers
   - Click "Create pull request"

2. **Reviewing a Pull Request**:
   - Review the code changes
   - Add comments on specific lines
   - Approve, request changes, or comment
   - Suggest changes directly in the code

3. **Merging a Pull Request**:
   - Ensure all reviews are complete
   - Ensure CI checks pass
   - Click "Merge pull request"
   - Choose merge method (merge, squash, rebase)
   - Delete branch when prompted (optional)

### GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions is a CI/CD platform that automates workflows:

1. **Workflow File Structure**:
   - YAML files in `.github/workflows` directory
   - Each workflow defined in separate file

2. **Basic Workflow Example**:

```yaml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    
    - name: Set up Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      with:
        node-version: '16'
        
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm ci
      
    - name: Run tests
      run: npm test
```

3. **Common Use Cases**:
   - Running tests
   - Linting code
   - Building and deploying applications
   - Publishing packages
   - Sending notifications

### GitHub Projects

GitHub Projects is a flexible project management tool:

1. **Creating a Project**:
   - Go to Projects tab
   - Click "New project"
   - Choose a template
   - Add a name and description

2. **Project Views**:
   - Table view for detailed information
   - Board view for kanban-style management
   - Timeline view for scheduling

3. **Automations**:
   - Auto-add new issues
   - Auto-move issues when closed
   - Custom workflow automations

## Advanced Git Techniques

### Git Hooks

Git hooks are scripts that run automatically when certain Git events occur:

1. **Client-Side Hooks**:
   - `pre-commit`: Runs before commit is created
   - `prepare-commit-msg`: Manipulates default commit message
   - `commit-msg`: Validates commit message
   - `post-commit`: Runs after commit is created

2. **Server-Side Hooks**:
   - `pre-receive`: Runs before refs are updated
   - `update`: Similar to pre-receive but runs once per ref
   - `post-receive`: Runs after successful push

3. **Example pre-commit Hook**:
```bash
#!/bin/sh
# .git/hooks/pre-commit
# Check for linting errors before committing

npm run lint
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "Linting failed! Fix errors before committing."
  exit 1
fi
```

### Git Submodules

Submodules allow you to keep a Git repository as a subdirectory of another Git repository:

```bash
# Add a submodule
git submodule add https://github.com/username/repository.git path/to/submodule

# Initialize submodules after cloning a repository with submodules
git submodule init
git submodule update

# Clone repository with submodules in one step
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/username/repository.git

# Update all submodules
git submodule update --remote
```

### Git LFS (Large File Storage)

Git LFS is an extension that replaces large files with text pointers, storing the actual files on a remote server:

```bash
# Install Git LFS
git lfs install

# Track specific file types
git lfs track "*.psd"
git lfs track "*.zip"

# Make sure to commit the .gitattributes file
git add .gitattributes
git commit -m "Track large files with Git LFS"

# Add and commit large files as normal
git add large-file.psd
git commit -m "Add design file"
git push
```

### Rewriting History

#### Interactive Rebase

```bash
# Rebase last 5 commits
git rebase -i HEAD~5

# Available commands in interactive rebase:
# pick - use commit as is
# reword - use commit, but edit the commit message
# edit - use commit, but stop for amending
# squash - use commit, but meld into previous commit
# fixup - like squash, but discard commit message
# drop - remove commit
```

#### Filter-branch

```bash
# Remove a file from the entire history
git filter-branch --force --index-filter \
  "git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch path/to/file" \
  --prune-empty -- --all
```

### Reflog

Git reflog is a log of all reference updates in the repository:

```bash
# View reflog
git reflog

# Recover deleted branch
git checkout -b recovered-branch HEAD@{1}

# Undo a hard reset
git reset --hard HEAD@{1}
```

## Best Practices

### Commit Best Practices

1. **Atomic Commits**:
   - Each commit should represent a single logical change
   - Makes it easier to understand, review, and revert

2. **Meaningful Commit Messages**:
   - Follow a consistent format like:
     ```
     <type>(<scope>): <short summary>
     
     <body>
     
     <footer>
     ```
   - Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore
   - Example: `feat(auth): add password reset functionality`

3. **Commit Often**:
   - Make small, frequent commits rather than large, infrequent ones
   - This helps identify where bugs were introduced

### Branching Best Practices

1. **Use Descriptive Branch Names**:
   - Feature branches: `feature/user-authentication`
   - Bug fixes: `fix/login-error`
   - Hotfixes: `hotfix/security-vulnerability`

2. **Keep Branches Short-lived**:
   - Merge or delete branches promptly after their purpose is fulfilled
   - Reduces merge conflicts and confusion

3. **Regularly Update Feature Branches**:
   - Rebase or merge from main branch regularly
   - Prevents "big bang" merges later

### Repository Maintenance

1. **Use .gitignore**:
   - Exclude build artifacts, dependencies, and environment-specific files
   - Helps keep the repository clean and focused on source code

2. **.gitignore Example**:
   ```
   # Node.js
   node_modules/
   npm-debug.log
   
   # Build directories
   dist/
   build/
   
   # Environment variables
   .env
   .env.local
   
   # IDE files
   .idea/
   .vscode/
   *.sublime-*
   
   # OS files
   .DS_Store
   Thumbs.db
   ```

3. **Git Attributes**:
   - Use .gitattributes to set per-file merge strategies
   - Configure line ending normalization
   - Set up language-specific diff tools

4. **.gitattributes Example**:
   ```
   # Set default behavior to automatically normalize line endings
   * text=auto
   
   # Explicitly declare text files
   *.html text
   *.css text
   *.js text
   
   # Declare files that are binary
   *.png binary
   *.jpg binary
   
   # Set specific merge driver for certain files
   package-lock.json merge=ours
   ```

### Git Security

1. **Avoid Storing Sensitive Data**:
   - Never commit API keys, passwords, or credentials
   - Use environment variables or secure storage solutions

2. **Sign Your Commits**:
   ```bash
   # Set up GPG key signing
   git config --global commit.gpgsign true
   
   # Sign a commit
   git commit -S -m "Secure commit message"
   ```

3. **Audit Your Repository**:
   - Regularly check for sensitive information
   - Use tools like `git-secrets` or `trufflehog` to scan history

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Merge Conflicts

1. **Prevention**:
   - Pull/rebase frequently
   - Break large changes into smaller chunks
   - Communicate with team members

2. **Resolution Process**:
   ```bash
   # When a conflict occurs during merge
   git status  # See which files are conflicted
   # Edit files manually to resolve conflicts
   git add resolved-files
   git commit  # Complete the merge
   ```

3. **Tools for Resolving Conflicts**:
   - VS Code's built-in merge editor
   - `git mergetool` with configured tool like vimdiff, kdiff3
   - GitHub's web interface for PR conflicts

### Detached HEAD

1. **What is it?**:
   - A state where HEAD points directly to a commit, not a branch
   - Occurs when checking out a specific commit, tag, or remote branch

2. **Solutions**:
   ```bash
   # Create a new branch at current position
   git checkout -b new-branch
   
   # OR move back to a branch
   git checkout main
   ```

### Reset vs. Revert

1. **Reset**: Moves the branch pointer and optionally modifies the staging area and working directory
   - Use for local changes not shared with others

2. **Revert**: Creates a new commit that undoes previous changes
   - Use for changes already pushed to shared repositories

```bash
# Reset example (local only)
git reset --hard HEAD~1

# Revert example (safe for shared repositories)
git revert HEAD
```

### Common Error Messages

1. **"Failed to push some refs"**:
   - Caused by remote having commits your local doesn't
   - Solution: `git pull` first, then push

2. **"Your local changes would be overwritten"**:
   ```bash
   # Stash your changes first
   git stash
   git pull
   git stash pop  # Apply your changes back
   ```

3. **"fatal: not a git repository"**:
   - Check if you're in the right directory
   - Make sure Git is initialized: `git init`

4. **"fatal: refusing to merge unrelated histories"**:
   ```bash
   # Force merge if you're sure it's safe
   git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories
   ```
